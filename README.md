Taskit is an IOS application using where you can store regular tasks and to-do items, as well as regularly repeating tasks, and be able to check them off when completed. Regular tasks will have the option to have notifications, and be automatically deleted when completed, while repeating tasks reset to become incomplete when the next time period has passed. 

This application was built using Swift and SwiftUI.

There are then two lists shown - one for regular one-time tasks, and the other for regular repeated tasks (i.e. weekly, fortnightly or monthly). When regular tasks are ticked off, they fade away and disappear, whereas when recurring tasks are ticked off, they disappear for the time being until they are to be completed again.  <br />
